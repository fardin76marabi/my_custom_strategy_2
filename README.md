Strategy: a high is gotten by a second candel, but the second candel closes below the first high if second low be gotten, we go to a sell to the first candel low

The robot identifies bearish reversal patterns (e.g., failed highs on H4 timeframe) and sells when price closes below a prior high, targeting the previous low. It uses EMA trends and shadow-to-body ratios for confirmation.
